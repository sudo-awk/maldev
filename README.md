My notes while learning malware devolepment, first install windows10 in a vmware. Here I used this repo to download windows.
>- Download the windows10 pro (https://github.com/mrrobot1o1/OS-Downloads)
>- Install c/c++ in your preferences in your code studio
>- Install vs studio code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
>- Install mingw as your compiler (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)
  >- Add  mingw bin to your environment path
>  -  Start making your first c/c++ code
